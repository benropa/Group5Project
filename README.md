## About
Welcome to our website application, "Home seekers!" Our mission is to connect loving families with their perfect furry companion. When you load into the site you are presented with a list of pets within your area that have been recently placed for adoption. If you would like to search for more you can enter your zip code for more pets recently put up for adoption in your area.
well now i want to know about whats near me type in my zipcode please
so many friends to choose from but lets go back to the original zip code to make sure those pets are still in that area.

ok now lets click on one of those furry friends and head into there page.

Now on top of the name, species,breed, gender, age, and size that are included with this cute little adoptable friends page.
One unique feature of our application is the inclusion of a YouTube video for each dog. These videos provide a more in-depth look at the personality and characteristics of the pet, allowing potential adopters to get a better sense of whether they would be a good match.

i'm thinking this pet could be for me but i wanna keep looking and not lose 
his page, 
well Users can also save their favorite dogs and have it appear on the front of the page, making it easy to keep track of which dogs they are interested in.

We understand that finding the right pet can be a daunting task, but with Home seekers, we hope to make the process as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Thank you for considering adoption and for using our application.

also the two dogs on top of the page are not up for adoption
